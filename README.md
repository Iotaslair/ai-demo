# Overview
This repo is meant to serve as a gentle introduction into Agents.

# Getting Started
1. [Install Opencode's UI](https://opencode.ai/download)
2. [Install Go](https://go.dev/dl/) or whatever programming language you want it to use
3. Launch Opencode in the directory of this Git Repo

# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a super common starting problem for programmers. Here's the problem description:

```
Create a go program that plays the children's game Fizz Buzz up to a hundred. Call the file fizzbuzz.go

Print out `Fizz` if a number is divisble by 3
Print out `Buzz` if a number is divisble by 5
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print out `FizzBuzz`
Print out the number if none of the above conditions are met
```

Copy paste the problem into the text box in Opencode's UI
Once it's done run the code with `go run fizzbuzz.go`

## Iterate with it
Let's say we want the program to replicate two people playing FizzBuzz. Something like:

Alice: 1
Bob: 2
Alice: Fizz
Bob: 4
Alice: Buzz

## Iterate some some
Ask it to add unit tests to the code. AI agents are at their best when they can verify if their output is correct. This is often why you see AI struggle with things like creative writing but can write code easily.

# Where to go from here
I hope you're starting to get excited because AI Agents can work with stuff much more complicated than a simple example like this. So start to experiment with it!

Here's an idea to get you started:

```
Create a terminal-based point-of-sale system written in go with order taking, tax calculation, receipt generation.
```
